Waterford City, steeped in history, heritage and culture, represents a unique blend of modern shopping centres, traditional pubs and highly acclaimed gourmet restaurants – 9 of the Bridgestone Guides top 100 restaurants in Ireland are located in County Waterford. There is also much to do and see as the city features three of Ireland premier visitor attractions. The Waterford Crystal Visitor Centre, the highly praised Waterford Museum of Treasures and the Waterford Walking Tour as well as Christ Church Cathedral. Most recently, a section of the Waterford to Dungarvan railway line has been rebuilt. From this narrow gauge railway, travelling at 15km per hour visitors can experience the beauty of the Suir Valley as they take in the panoramic views of the river, rolling farmland, and mountains. You can also enjoy views of the River Suir by taking a trip on the heritage train of Waterford and Suir Valley Railway.</p></div><!-- </div> -->

Dungarvan Town, the administrative capital for the county, is set in a broad, magnificent bay. Renowned as an angling and golfing centre, it forms the commercial heart of County Waterford. Nearby is Ring (An Rinn), a flourishing centre for Irish culture and language, and Ardmore, a charming coastal resort as well as the arrival point of St Declan in the first half of the fifth century, supposedly the very first of Ireland's proselytizing Christians, preceding St Patrick. Also in West Waterford lie the towns of Lismore, Cappoquin, and Ballymacarbry – The Nire Valley. All forming a natural playground for Equestrian, Walking, Angling, Water Sports and Cycling holidays.</p>

<p>Dotted along Waterford County’s spectacular coastline (see Coastal Drive) are towns and villages, each with their own unique charms. Dunmore East is a charming fishing village with first class restaurants that specialize in the ‘catch of the day’. Tramore, Ireland’s premier seaside resort, has a truly spectacular beach, a fun park and Splashworld, an indoor water extravaganza for kiddies and parents alike.
