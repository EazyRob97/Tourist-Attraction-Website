# Tourist-Attraction-Website:
This was my first assignment in my first year for Website Development. The objective was to create a Tourist Attraction Website for People living outside the SouthEast and abroad that would contain information for them to view when making a decision to visit the south-eastern region of Ireland. On top of this Project a layer of Bootstrap was also applied.
