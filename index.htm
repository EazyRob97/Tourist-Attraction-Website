<p>The South East of Ireland, comprising the five counties of Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford, is an evocative patchwork of fertile valleys and plains. Down through the centuries the Celts, Vikings, Anglo-Saxons and Normans have passed through these valleys, leaving behind a landscape rich in historical remains. Countless castles, abbeys, fortresses and ancient settlements remain to mark their passage. The five river systems â€“ the Barrow, Blackwater, Nore, Slaney and Suir - criss-cross the South East, meandering under old stone bridges, around magical mountains, through picturesque villages and past neatly thatched cottages before finally entering the sea at scenic, peaceful seaside towns.</p>

The South East has things to do for everyone of all ages and tastes: historic monuments, colourful gardens; well-maintained and sign-posted walking and cycling paths; abundant fishing locations; numerous golf courses, equestrian centres and exciting festivals. From coast to country, the South East has it all. Come see it for yourself...</p>
